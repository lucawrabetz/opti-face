### Software Requirements Document (SRD) for Opti-Face

#### Preliminaries / Definitions
**opti-fork**: A fork of the opti-face software framework, customized and implemented for a specific computational problem or research study.

#### 1. Introduction

**Purpose**:
The purpose of the opti-face software framework is to provide a robust, flexible, and scalable platform for researchers and practitioners to execute and analyze computational experiments for any computational problem, following a guided implementation of the problem structure and solution approaches. This system is designed to reduce redundancy in research workflows, streamline data analysis, and enhance the reproducibility of scientific studies.

**Scope**:
Opti-face is intended to serve as a customizable framework that can be adapted to different computational problems and research needs. Following the guided implementation, the software automates the encoding of problem instances, execution of algorithms, and comprehensive analysis of experiment results. It supports extensive customization to accommodate specific research requirements, making it ideal for academic and professional research environments.

#### 2. Overall Description

**Product Perspective**:
Opti-face is conceived as an interface of abstract data structures, that upon implementation provides a fully functional standalone framework that integrates seamlessly with existing research tools and data management systems. It operates within the broader ecosystem of scientific computing tools, enhancing and not replacing tools used for specific analytical tasks or data manipulation.

**Product Functions**:
*(requires implementation)* - indicates a component that is comprised of an abstract interface, which must be implemented by the user following our instructions.
*(turn-key)* - indicates a component that is fully functional once all components marked as *(requires implementation)* are correctly implemented.
- **Solver Suite** *(requires implemententation)*: Manages the setup and execution of computational experiments, including problem instance encoding and solver operations.
- **Data Explorer** *(turn-key)*: Provides tools for detailed data analysis and visualization, helping users to derive insights from experimental results.
- **Data Model** *(requires implementation)*: Central to system configuration, it defines the data schema and ensures consistency across the platform.
- **Results Data Store** *(turn-key)*: Safeguards experimental data, supporting robust data retrieval and backup functionalities.

**User Characteristics**:
- **End Users (Researchers)**: Researchers who use the system to conduct experiments. They require a system that is reliable, efficient, and user-friendly, allowing them to focus on research outcomes rather than software intricacies.
- **Implementers (System Customizers)**: Technical users or developers who set up and configure the system to suit specific research needs. They are responsible for initial system setup, customizations, and updates, ensuring that the software accurately reflects the research requirements. It's noted that the populations of end users and implementers can overlap, with individuals often fulfilling both roles.

**Assumptions and Dependencies**:
- Implementers are assumed to fully and correctly implement certain abstract interfaces and declare specific schemas following clear instructions provided within the library. This is crucial for the proper functioning of the system.

- Comprehensive backup solutions and disaster recovery strategies to ensure data availability and continuity.

**User Interface**
- Develop a minimal yet robust and clean UI that operates effectively within terminal environments, ensuring reusability across the Solver Suite and Data Explorer.

#### 4. Non-functional Requirements

**Performance**
- An opti-fork expected to manage between 10K and 100K rows over its lifetime without performance degradation.
- Support for a small team of end-users with some concurrent usage.

**Reliability**
- Each implementation must target 100% uptime, recognizing the critical nature of ongoing research activities.

**Security**
- Implement preventative measures against data loss, including regular backups and rigorous testing of data handling routines.

**Usability**
- The system should be intuitive for both end-users and implementers, requiring minimal training for the former and easy configurability for the latter.
- Detailed tutorials and user guides will facilitate easy system navigation and feature utilization.
- Minimize configuration steps for implementers, ensuring that implementation instructions are straightforward and well-documented.
