# opti-<span style="color: red;">face</span> :-<span style="color: red;">)</span>
An (almost) turn-key suite of tools for heavily automated experiments in computational research.

## Description
opti-face provides a robust, easy to implement, and hard-to-mess-up interface for a computational problem, any algorithms that may be used to solve it, and all data auxiliary to the process of analyzing them. Upon following the steps in [Installation](#installation), a user will immediately have access to robust automations to run experiments, a secure database that automagically sets itself up, and a growing suite of post-processing tools.
