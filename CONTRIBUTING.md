# Contributing to opti-face

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Contributing code
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use the Forking Workflow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:
1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Make your changes**: Implement your feature or bug fix.
3. **Add tests** if you've added code that should be tested.
4. **Ensure the test suite passes**.
5. **Commit your changes**: Ensure your commit messages are clear.
6. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request to our `main` branch.
7. Wait for your pull request to be reviewed and discussed. Make any necessary updates based on feedback.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/lucawrabetz/opti-face/issues)
Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work, or any other relevant information)
